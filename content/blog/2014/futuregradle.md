## Der Vortrag

**The Future of Gradle - The Ultimate Build System**
(*Hans Dockter*):
We are convinced that Gradle is already the best
available enterprise build system. Yet we are far from done.
We have finally the R&D bandwidth to deeply improve Gradle
in the areas where it lacks. We also have the bandwidth to
contribute some fundamental innovation to the domain of build
and continuous delivery. All this will bring Gradle much closer to
our vision of Gradle being the ultimate build system.

We start by giving an overview of where Gradle is currently in
the build system market when it comes to features and adoption.
We will then talk about the next generation multi-platform
dependency management. A dependency management that can fully
capture the requirements of Android, JavaScript and the native
domain as well as to improve the dependency management for the
Java world. We will talk about how Gradle will dramatically improve
the performance by introducing global caches and other optimizations.
Finally we will talk about the new Gradle extendability model and
its upcoming native and JavaScript support.
